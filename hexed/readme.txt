This is rather simple address space viewer for Genesis/Megadrive. It is capable
of displaying 216 bytes of memory simultaneously in a manner similar to some
hex editors for the PC, with refresh of 50/60Hz. It was created for hardware
research purposes.

Here are the key bindings:
  A + up, A + down    - scroll one line up/down.
  A + left, A + right - scroll one page up/down.
  B     - toggle between byte/word display/edit mode.
  C     - edit highlighted value.
  Start - enter menu.


hexed is released under the BSD license (see included source code for details).
